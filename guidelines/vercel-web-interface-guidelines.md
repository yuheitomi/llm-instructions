Interfaces succeed because of hundreds of choices. This is a living, non-exhaustive list of those decisions. Most guidelines are framework-agnostic, some specific to React/Next.js. [Feedback is welcome](https://github.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/tree/main).

- **[Keyboard works everywhere.](https://vercel.com/design/#keyboard-works-everywhere)** All flows are keyboard-operable & follow the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).
- **[Clear focus.](https://vercel.com/design/#clear-focus)** Every focusable element shows a visible focus ring. Prefer `:focus-visible` over `:focus` to avoid distracting pointer users. Set `:focus-within` for grouped controls.
- **[Manage focus.](https://vercel.com/design/#manage-focus)** Use focus traps, move & return focus according to the [WAI-ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/).
- **[Match visual & hit targets.](https://vercel.com/design/#match-visual-hit-targets)** Exception: if the visual target is < 24px, expand its hit target to ≥ 24px. On mobile, the minimum size is 44px.
- **[Mobile input size.](https://vercel.com/design/#mobile-input-size)**`<input>` font size is ≥ 16px on mobile to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom/pan on focus. Or set `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1" />`.
- **[Respect zoom.](https://vercel.com/design/#respect-zoom)** Never disable browser zoom.
- **[Hydration-safe inputs.](https://vercel.com/design/#hydration-safe-inputs)** Inputs must not lose focus or value after hydration.
- **[Don’t block paste.](https://vercel.com/design/#dont-block-paste)** Never disable paste in `<input>` or `<textarea>`.
- Show a loading indicator & keep the original label.
- If you show a spinner/skeleton, add a short show-delay (~150–300 ms) & a minimum visible time (~300–500 ms) to avoid flicker on fast responses. The `<Suspense>` component in React does this automatically.
- **[URL as state.](https://vercel.com/design/#url-as-state)** Persist state in the URL so share, refresh, Back/Forward navigation work e.g., [nuqs](https://nuqs.dev/).
- **[Optimistic updates.](https://vercel.com/design/#optimistic-updates)** Update the UI immediately when success is likely; reconcile on server response. On failure, show an error & roll back or provide Undo.
- Menu options that open a follow-up e.g., "Rename…" & loading/processing states e.g., "Loading…", "Saving…", "Generating…" end with an ellipsis.
- **[Confirm destructive actions.](https://vercel.com/design/#confirm-destructive-actions)** Require confirmation or provide Undo with a safe window.
- **[Prevent double-tap zoom on controls.](https://vercel.com/design/#prevent-double-tap-zoom-on-controls)** Set `touch-action: manipulation`.
- **[Tap highlight follows design.](https://vercel.com/design/#tap-highlight-follows-design)** Set `webkit-tap-highlight-color`.
- Controls minimize finickiness with generous hit targets, clear affordances, & predictable interactions, e.g., [prediction cones](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1657083267299028992).
- Delay the first tooltip in a group; [subsequent peers have no delay](https://x.com/emilkowalski_/status/1962500739336462340).
- **[Overscroll behavior.](https://vercel.com/design/#overscroll-behavior)** Set `overscroll-behavior: contain` intentionally e.g., in modals/drawers.
- **[Scroll positions persist.](https://vercel.com/design/#scroll-positions-persist)** Back/Forward restores prior scroll.
- **[Autofocus for speed.](https://vercel.com/design/#autofocus-for-speed)** On desktop screens with a single primary input, autofocus. Rarely autofocus on mobile because the keyboard opening can cause layout shift.
- **[No dead zones.](https://vercel.com/design/#no-dead-zones)** If part of a control looks interactive, it should be interactive. Don’t leave users guessing where to interact.
- **[Deep-link everything.](https://vercel.com/design/#deep-link-everything)** Filters, tabs, pagination, expanded panels, anytime `useState` is used.
- Disable text selection & apply [`inert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/inert) (which prevents interaction) while an element is dragged so selection/hover don't occur simultaneously.
- **[Links are links.](https://vercel.com/design/#links-are-links)** Use `<a>` or `<Link>` for navigation so standard browser behaviors work (Cmd/Ctrl+Click, middle-click, right-click to open in a new tab). Never substitute with `<button>` or `<div>` for navigational links.
- **[Announce async updates.](https://vercel.com/design/#announce-async-updates)** Use polite aria-live for toasts & inline validation.
- **[Locale-aware keyboard shortcuts.](https://vercel.com/design/#locale-aware-keyboard-shortcuts)** Internationalize keyboard shortcuts for non-QWERTY layouts. Show platform-specific symbols.

## Animations

- **[Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.](https://vercel.com/design/#honor-prefers-reduced-motion)** Provide a reduced-motion variant.
- **[Implementation preference.](https://vercel.com/design/#implementation-preference)** Prefer CSS, avoid main-thread JS-driven animations when possible.
  - Preference: CSS > Web Animations API > JavaScript libraries e.g., [motion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/motion).
- **[Compositor-friendly.](https://vercel.com/design/#compositor-friendly)** Prioritize GPU-accelerated properties (`transform`, `opacity`) & avoid properties that trigger reflows/repaints (`width`, `height`, `top`, `left`).
- **[Necessity check.](https://vercel.com/design/#necessity-check)** Only animate when it clarifies cause & effect or when it adds deliberate delight e.g., [the northern lights](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1831380516509278561).
- **[Easing fits the subject.](https://vercel.com/design/#easing-fits-the-subject)** Choose easing based on what changes (size, distance, trigger).
- **[Interruptible.](https://vercel.com/design/#interruptible)** Animations are cancelable by user input.
- **[Input-driven.](https://vercel.com/design/#input-driven)** Avoid autoplay; animate in response to actions.
- **[Correct transform origin.](https://vercel.com/design/#correct-transform-origin)** Anchor motion to where it “physically” starts.
- **[Never `transition: all`.](https://vercel.com/design/#never-transition-all)** Explicitly list only the properties you intend to animate (typically `opacity`, `transform`). `all` can unintentionally animate layout-affecting properties causing jank.
- **[Cross-browser SVG transforms.](https://vercel.com/design/#cross-browser-svg-transforms)** Apply CSS transforms/animations to `<g>` wrappers & set `transform-box: fill-box; transform-origin: center;`. Safari historically had bugs with transform-origin on SVG & grouping avoids origin miscalculation.

## Layout

- **[Optical alignment.](https://vercel.com/design/#optical-alignment)**[Adjust ±1px](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1760444698857230360) when perception beats geometry.
- **[Deliberate alignment.](https://vercel.com/design/#deliberate-alignment)** Every element aligns with something intentionally whether to a grid, baseline, edge, or optical center. No accidental positioning.
- **[Balance contrast in lockups.](https://vercel.com/design/#balance-contrast-in-lockups)** When text & icons sit side by side, adjust weight, size, spacing, or color so they don’t clash. For example, a thin-stroke icon may need a bolder stroke next to medium-weight text.
- **[Responsive coverage.](https://vercel.com/design/#responsive-coverage)** Verify on mobile, laptop, & ultra-wide. For ultra-wide, zoom out to 50% to simulate.
- **[Respect safe areas.](https://vercel.com/design/#respect-safe-areas)** Account for notches & insets with [safe-area variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/env).
- **[No excessive scrollbars.](https://vercel.com/design/#no-excessive-scrollbars)** Only render useful scrollbars; fix overflow issues to prevent unwanted scrollbars. On macOS set ["Show scroll bars" to "Always"](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-appearance-settings-mchlp1225/mac#:~:text=or%20status%20bars.-,Show%20scroll%20bars,-Scroll%20bars%20appear) to test what Windows users would see.
- **[Let the browser size things.](https://vercel.com/design/#let-the-browser-size-things)** Prefer flex/grid/intrinsic layout over measuring in JS. Avoid layout thrash by letting CSS handle flow, wrapping, & alignment.
- **[Inline help first.](https://vercel.com/design/#inline-help-first)** Prefer inline explanations; use tooltips as a last resort.
- **[Stable skeletons.](https://vercel.com/design/#stable-skeletons)** Skeletons mirror final content exactly to avoid layout shift.
- `<title>` reflects the current context.
- **[No dead ends.](https://vercel.com/design/#no-dead-ends)** Every screen offers a next step or recovery path.
- **[All states designed.](https://vercel.com/design/#all-states-designed)** Empty, sparse, dense, & error states.
- **[Typographic quotes.](https://vercel.com/design/#typographic-quotes)** Prefer curly quotes (“ ”) over straight quotes (" ").
- **[Avoid widows/orphans.](https://vercel.com/design/#avoid-widowsorphans)** Tidy rag & line breaks.
- **[Tabular numbers for comparisons.](https://vercel.com/design/#tabular-numbers-for-comparisons)** Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` or a monospace like [Geist Mono](https://vercel.com/font).
- **[Redundant status cues.](https://vercel.com/design/#redundant-status-cues)** Don’t rely on color alone; include text labels.
- Convey the same meaning with text for non-sighted users.
- **[Don’t ship the schema.](https://vercel.com/design/#dont-ship-the-schema)** Visual layouts may omit visible labels, but accessible names/labels still exist for assistive tech.
- **[Use the ellipsis character.](https://vercel.com/design/#use-the-ellipsis-character)**`…` over three periods `...`.
- **[Anchored headings.](https://vercel.com/design/#anchored-headings)** Set `scroll-margin-top` for headers when linking to sections.
- **[Resilient to user-generated content.](https://vercel.com/design/#resilient-to-user-generated-content)** Layouts handle short, average, & very long content.
- **[Locale-aware formats.](https://vercel.com/design/#locale-aware-formats)** Format dates, times, numbers, delimiters, & currencies for the user’s locale.
- **[Prefer language settings over location.](https://vercel.com/design/#prefer-language-settings-over-location)** Detect language via `Accept-Language` header & `navigator.languages`. Never rely on IP/GPS for language.
- **[Accessible content.](https://vercel.com/design/#accessible-content)** Set accurate names (`aria-label`), hide decoration (`aria-hidden`) & verify in the [accessibility tree](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/full-accessibility-tree).
- **[Icon-only buttons are named.](https://vercel.com/design/#icon-only-buttons-are-named)** Provide a descriptive `aria-label`.
- **[Semantics before ARIA.](https://vercel.com/design/#semantics-before-aria)** Prefer native elements (`button`, `a`, `label`, `table`), before `aria-*`.
- Hierarchical `<h1–h6>` & a “Skip to content” link.
- **[Brand resources from the logo.](https://vercel.com/design/#brand-resources-from-the-logo)**[Right-click the nav logo](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1636427186566762496) to surface brand assets for quick access.
- **[Non-breaking spaces for glued terms.](https://vercel.com/design/#non-breaking-spaces-for-glued-terms)** Use a non-breaking space `&nbsp;` to keep units, shortcuts & names together: `10 MB` → `10&nbsp;MB`, `⌘ + K` → `⌘&nbsp;+&nbsp;K`, `Vercel SDK` → `Vercel&nbsp;SDK`. Use `&#x2060;` for no space.

## Forms

- **[Enter submits.](https://vercel.com/design/#enter-submits)** When a text input is focused, Enter submits if it's the only control. If there are many controls, apply to the last control.
- **[Textarea behavior.](https://vercel.com/design/#textarea-behavior)** In `<textarea>`, ⌘/⌃+Enter submits; Enter inserts a new line.
- **[Labels everywhere.](https://vercel.com/design/#labels-everywhere)** Every control has a `<label>` or is associated with a label for assistive tech.
- **[Label activation.](https://vercel.com/design/#label-activation)** Clicking a `<label>` focuses the associated control.
- **[Submission rule.](https://vercel.com/design/#submission-rule)** Keep submit enabled until submission starts; then disable during the in-flight request, show a spinner, & include an idempotency key.
- **[Don’t block typing.](https://vercel.com/design/#dont-block-typing)** Even if a field only accepts numbers, allow any input & show validation feedback. Blocking keystrokes entirely is confusing because the user gets no explanation.
- **[Don’t pre-disable submit.](https://vercel.com/design/#dont-pre-disable-submit)** Allow submitting incomplete forms to surface validation feedback.
- **[No dead zones on controls.](https://vercel.com/design/#no-dead-zones-on-controls)** Checkboxes & radios avoid dead zones; the label & control share a single generous hit target.
- Show errors next to their fields; on submit, focus the first error.
- **[Autocomplete & names.](https://vercel.com/design/#autocomplete-names)** Set `autocomplete` & meaningful `name` values to enable autofill.
- **[Spellcheck selectively.](https://vercel.com/design/#spellcheck-selectively)** Disable for emails, codes, usernames, etc.
- **[Correct types & input modes.](https://vercel.com/design/#correct-types-input-modes)** Use the right `type` & `inputmode` for better keyboards & validation.
- **[Placeholders signal emptiness.](https://vercel.com/design/#placeholders-signal-emptiness)** End with an ellipsis.
- **[Placeholder value.](https://vercel.com/design/#placeholder-value)** Set placeholder to an example value or pattern e.g., `+1 (123) 456-7890` & `sk-012345679…`
- **[Unsaved changes.](https://vercel.com/design/#unsaved-changes)** Warn before navigation when data could be lost.
- **[Password managers & 2FA.](https://vercel.com/design/#password-managers-2fa)** Ensure compatibility & allow pasting one-time codes.
- **[Don’t trigger password managers for non-auth fields.](https://vercel.com/design/#dont-trigger-password-managers-for-non-auth-fields)** For inputs like “Search” avoid reserved names (e.g., password), use `autocomplete="off"` or a specific token like `autocomplete="one-time-code"` for OTP fields.
- **[Text replacements & expansions.](https://vercel.com/design/#text-replacements-expansions)** Some input methods add trailing whitespace. The input should trim the value to avoid showing a confusing error message.
- **[Windows `<select>` background.](https://vercel.com/design/#windows-select-background)** Explicitly set `background-color` & `color` on native `<select>` to avoid dark-mode contrast bugs on Windows.

## Performance

- **[Device/browser matrix.](https://vercel.com/design/#devicebrowser-matrix)** Test iOS Low Power Mode & macOS Safari.
- **[Measure reliably.](https://vercel.com/design/#measure-reliably)** Disable extensions that add overhead or change runtime behavior.
- **[Track re-renders.](https://vercel.com/design/#track-re-renders)** Minimize & make re-renders fast. Use [React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) or [React Scan](https://react-scan.com/).
- **[Throttle when profiling.](https://vercel.com/design/#throttle-when-profiling)** Test with CPU & network throttling.
- **[Minimize layout work.](https://vercel.com/design/#minimize-layout-work)** Batch reads/writes; avoid unnecessary reflows/repaints.
- **[Network latency budgets.](https://vercel.com/design/#network-latency-budgets)**`POST/PATCH/DELETE` complete in <500ms.
- **[Keystroke cost.](https://vercel.com/design/#keystroke-cost)** Prefer uncontrolled inputs; make controlled loops cheap.
- **[Large lists.](https://vercel.com/design/#large-lists)** Virtualize large lists e.g., [virtua](https://github.com/inokawa/virtua) or [content-visibility: auto](https://web.dev/articles/content-visibility).
- **[Preload wisely.](https://vercel.com/design/#preload-wisely)** Preload only above-the-fold images; lazy-load the rest.
- **[No image-caused CLS.](https://vercel.com/design/#no-image-caused-cls)** Set explicit image dimensions & reserve space.
- **[Preconnect to origins.](https://vercel.com/design/#preconnect-to-origins)** Use `<link rel="preconnect">` for asset/CDN domains (with crossorigin when needed) to reduce DNS/TLS latency.
- **[Preload fonts.](https://vercel.com/design/#preload-fonts)** For critical text to avoid flash & layout shift.
- **[Subset fonts.](https://vercel.com/design/#subset-fonts)** Ship only the code points/scripts you use via unicode-range (limit variable axes to what you need) to shrink size.
- **[Don’t use the main thread for expensive work.](https://vercel.com/design/#dont-use-the-main-thread-for-expensive-work)** Move especially long tasks to [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) to avoid blocking interaction with the page.

## Design

- **[Layered shadows.](https://vercel.com/design/#layered-shadows)** Mimic ambient + direct light with at least two layers.
- **[Crisp borders.](https://vercel.com/design/#crisp-borders)** Combine borders & shadows; semi-transparent borders improve edge clarity.
- **[Nested radii.](https://vercel.com/design/#nested-radii)** Child radius ≤ parent radius & concentric so curves align.
- **[Hue consistency.](https://vercel.com/design/#hue-consistency)** On non-neutral backgrounds, tint borders/shadows/text toward the same hue.
- **[Accessible charts.](https://vercel.com/design/#accessible-charts)** Use color-blind-friendly palettes.
- **[Minimum contrast.](https://vercel.com/design/#minimum-contrast)** Prefer [APCA](https://apcacontrast.com/) over [WCAG 2](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) for more accurate perceptual contrast.
- `:hover`, `:active`, `:focus` have more contrast than rest state.
- **[Browser UI matches your background.](https://vercel.com/design/#browser-ui-matches-your-background)** Set `<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000">` to [align the browser’s theme color with the page background](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1816160187839107342).
- **[Set the appropriate color-scheme.](https://vercel.com/design/#set-the-appropriate-color-scheme)** Style the `<html>` tag with `color-scheme: dark` in dark themes so that scrollbars and other device UI have proper contrast.
- **[Text anti-aliasing & transforms.](https://vercel.com/design/#text-anti-aliasing-transforms)** Scaling text can change smoothing. Prefer animating a wrapper instead of the text node. If artifacts persist set `translateZ(0)` or `will-change: transform` to promote to its own layer.
- **[Avoid gradient banding.](https://vercel.com/design/#avoid-gradient-banding)** Some colors & display types will have color banding. [Masks can be used instead](https://x.com/JohnPhamous/status/1724491202148675590).

## Vercel-specific

These preferences reflect Vercel’s brand & product choices. They aren’t universal guidelines.

## Copywriting

- **[Active voice.](https://vercel.com/design/#active-voice)**
  - Instead of “ _The CLI will be installed,”_ say _“Install the CLI.”_
- **[Headings & buttons use Title Case](https://vercel.com/design/#headings-buttons-use-title-case)** ([Chicago](https://title.sh/)). On marketing pages, use sentence case.
- **[Be clear & concise.](https://vercel.com/design/#be-clear-concise)** Use as few words as possible.
- **[Prefer `&` over `and`.](https://vercel.com/design/#prefer-over-and)**
- **[Action-oriented language.](https://vercel.com/design/#action-oriented-language)**
  - Instead of _“You will need the CLI…”_ say _“Install the CLI…”_.
- **[Keep nouns consistent.](https://vercel.com/design/#keep-nouns-consistent)** Introduce as few unique terms as possible.
- **[Write in second person.](https://vercel.com/design/#write-in-second-person)** Avoid first person.
- **[Use consistent placeholders.](https://vercel.com/design/#use-consistent-placeholders)**
  - Strings: `YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE`. Numbers: `0123456789`.
- **[Use numerals for counts.](https://vercel.com/design/#use-numerals-for-counts)**
  - Instead of _“eight deployments”_ say _“8 deployments”_.
- **[Consistent currency formatting.](https://vercel.com/design/#consistent-currency-formatting)** In any given context, display currency with either 0 or 2 decimal places, never mix both.
- **[Separate numbers & units with a space.](https://vercel.com/design/#separate-numbers-units-with-a-space)**
  - Instead of `10MB` say `10 MB`.
  - Use a non-breaking space e.g., `10&nbsp;MB`.
- **[Default to positive language.](https://vercel.com/design/#default-to-positive-language)** Frame messages in an encouraging, problem-solving way, even for errors.
  - Instead of _“Your deployment failed,”_ say _“Something went wrong—try again or contact support.”_
- Don’t just state what went wrong—tell the user how to fix it.
  - Instead of _“Invalid API key,”_ say _“Your API key is incorrect or expired. Generate a new key in your account settings.”_ The copy & buttons/links should educate & give a clear action.
- **[Avoid ambiguity.](https://vercel.com/design/#avoid-ambiguity)** Labels are clear & specific.
  - Instead of the button label _“Continue”_ say _“Save API Key”_.
