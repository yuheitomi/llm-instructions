Please help me commit my changes. Here's what I need you to do:

1. First, check the current git status to see what files have been modified
2. Analyze the changes and group them into 2-3 logical commits based on:
   - File types (tests, docs, config, etc.)
   - Feature areas (by directory/module)
   - Purpose of changes
3. Present the proposed commit chunks to the user and ask for confirmation before proceeding
4. Create separate commits for each logical group with appropriate commit messages following conventional commit format
5. Run typecheck or lint commands (if available in package.json) before committing to ensure code quality
6. If '$ARGUMENTS' is provided, use it as the target branch name (otherwise default to 'main')

Make sure each commit message ends with:
