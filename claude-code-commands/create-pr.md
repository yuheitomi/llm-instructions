# Instruction

Please help me commit my changes and create a pull request. Here's what I need you to do:

1. Check '$ARGUMENTS' for any specific instructions regarding the pull request target branch or additional context.
2. Then, check the current git status to see what files have been modified
3. Analyze the changes and group them into logical commits based on:
   - File types (tests, docs, config, etc.)
   - Feature areas (by directory/module)
   - Purpose of changes
4. Create separate commits for each logical group with appropriate commit messages following conventional commit format
5. Run typecheck or lint commands (if available in package.json) before committing to ensure code quality
6. Push the changes to the remote repository
7. Create a pull request to the target branch (check '$ARGUMENTS' if provided, otherwise default to 'main')
8. The PR should include:
   - A descriptive title
   - Summary of changes
   - List of commits included

Make sure each commit message ends with:

```text
Generated with AI assistant
```

For the pull request body, include a proper summary and the same attribution.
