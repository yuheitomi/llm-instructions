Please help me commit my changes and create a pull request. Here's what I need you to do:

1. First, check the current git status to see what files have been modified
2. Analyze the changes and group them into logical commits based on:
   - File types (tests, docs, config, etc.)
   - Feature areas (by directory/module)
   - Purpose of changes
3. Create separate commits for each logical group with appropriate commit messages following conventional commit format
4. Push the changes to the remote repository
5. Create a pull request to the target branch (use '$ARGUMENTS' if provided, otherwise default to 'dev')
6. The PR should include:
   - A descriptive title
   - Summary of changes
   - List of commits included

Make sure each commit message ends with:

```
ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

For the pull request body, include a proper summary and the same attribution.
